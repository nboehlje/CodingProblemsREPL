# Coding Problems REPL (CRP) 

- A REPL for practicing coding and software engineering related problems. 
- Really, you could use this for learning any subject as it's just a simple flashcard tool that lives in your terminal.

## Motivation 
A source of inspiration for this project is Anki flashcards but in your terminal. You use the REPL to practice on *your own* problems and solutions. The REPL will use a learning strategy similar to Anki for improving your retention.
